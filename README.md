# CodeOptimax

## Description
CodeOptimax is a web application designed to demonstrate various algorithms related to the Design and Analysis of Algorithms (DAA). The project includes implementations of several key algorithms, including Huffman Encoding, Sorting Algorithms, the Knapsack Problem, and the Longest Common Subsequence (LCS). This application serves as both a learning tool and a reference for students and enthusiasts of computer science.

## Features
- **Huffman Encoding:** Visualizes the process of data compression using Huffman coding.
- **Sorting Algorithms:** Demonstrates various sorting algorithms, including Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, and Quick Sort, with visual animations.
- **Knapsack Problem:** Provides an interactive solution to the 0/1 Knapsack Problem, illustrating dynamic programming techniques.
- **Longest Common Subsequence (LCS):** Shows how to find the longest common subsequence between two strings with a step-by-step explanation.

## Technologies Used
- **Backend:** Flask
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Version Control:** Git, GitHub
